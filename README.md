# Load Default Predicter AI
This repository contains a loan default prediction model that uses customer, loan, and financial data to optimize loan portfolio profitability by identifying high-risk applicants early.

## Overview
- Build a predictive model for loan default within 12 months

## Dataset Overview
- **Loans**: Loan information including amount, term, and purpose. 
- **Customers**: Customer information including demographics, birth date, and bank engagement details.
- **Customer Financials**: Financial information of customers from 2016 to 2018 including monthly salary and account balances.
- **Loan Delinquencies**: Delinquency information of loans within the first 12 installments.

> Note: For confidentiality reasons, only the first 5 rows of each dataset have been retained as examples.

## Key Definitions

- **Default**: A loan is considered defaulted if 3 consecutive monthly installments are missed.
- **Delinquency**: The state of a loan when an installment is overdue.

## Setup
Install required libraries:

> cd <your_directory>\Loan-Default-Predicter-AI

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Training (with best hyperparameters and final dataset):
To train XGBoost model without optimization and data preprocessing.

> python main.py --mode training --model_type XGB

### Training (from scratch):
To train XGBoost model from scratch (takes around 30 minutes).

> python main.py --mode training --model_type XGB --use_raw_data --run_optimization

### Evaluation:
To evaluate the trained XGBoost model.

> python main.py --mode evaluation --model_type XGB
